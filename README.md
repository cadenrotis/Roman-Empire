# COM-S-319-Final Project
This repository contains Caden Otis's and Brandon Rau's final project for COM S 319.

# Project Overview:
Our final project for COM S 3190 was to combine everything that we learned in the course to make a unique and interactive website. Brandon and I's final project, which is the timeline of the major events that took place during the era of the Roman Empire, was designed to solve the difficulty and amount of time that is required to research significant events about the Roman Empire. If you want to learn about something such as the First Punic War, you have to search and go through at least a couple of websites to get the key points about the war. That takes time and much more effort than what should be required. With our final project, we provide key summaries of the main events that took place during the existence of the Roman Empire. If users of our webpage are interested in a certain event/s and want to learn more, we also provide resources to other reliable websites to prevent our users from having to leave our webpage and spend too much having to search through websites on their own. 

# My Role:
I focused on both the frontend and backend integration for this website, where I:
 * Used JavaScript to create multiple views within our website
 * Used React to handle the switching between views via a menu
 * Created quizzes for most views to had some user interaction within our website
 * Added buttons that when clicked, would show a popup containing a fun fact about Rome
 * Used JavaScript to perform CRUD operations to manage website information within a MongoDB database

# Learnings:
During this project I learned a lot about using React to create different views/webpages within a website. I also learned a lot about JavaScript and how I can use the language to peform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database that we managed.
